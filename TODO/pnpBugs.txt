pnp bugs

sql
	the phone numbers that are in the default db come out to be the same

html
	When resizing profile page, make sure attributes stay aligned with their respective title.

css

js
	added jquery - Wahoo!

php
	not clear why signup php needs the db declared in the function
	this function code isn't entirely clear either. 

		the rating db query is hard because its doesnt get the xact value

	must check that the sql response is good
